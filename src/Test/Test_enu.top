#1.  "\vol=value\" (value between 0 and 100) : changes the volume of TTS. The default value is 80, and values above can introduce clipping to the audio signal.

#2.  "\rspd=value\" (value between 50 and 400) : changes the speed of TTS (default value is 100).

#3.  "\vct=value\" (value between 50 and 200) : changes the pitch of TTS (default value is 100).

#4. “\rst\” : resets all parameters to the default values

#5.  "\emph=value\" : changes the emphasis of TTS for the word following the tag
#    1. 0: reduced
#    2. 1: stressed
#    3. 2: accented
    
#6.  “\bound=value\” : changes the prosodic boundary after the next word (all languages but Japanese)
#    4. W: Weak phrase boundary (equivalent to a comma, but without the small pause)
#    5. S: Strong phrase boundary (equivalent to a comma)
#    6. N: No boundary (suppresses a boundary set by TTS)
    
#7.  “\eos=value\” : suppresses (value=0) or forces (value=1) a sentence break (all languages but Japanese)

#This means that we can definitely use pepper within the presentation if we wanted to...
