u:(e:onHernandez) Ms. Hernandez is the teacher for AP Calculus A.B. and AP Calculus B.C. Ms. Hernandez loves math so much that she is the sponsor for Math and Theories Club. Also, did you know she hosts Brownie Thursdays for her students? I love brownies! In her classes, Ms. Herndandez teaches her students about the foundations of calculus. She teaches them derivatives and integrals, with plenty of application questions in the mix. Her second course, Calculus B C, expands upon the concepts found in the first. $onStopped=1

u:(e:onPowers) Mr. Powers is the teacher of AP Statistics and AP Calculus A.B. He always writes an interesting topic of the week and joke of the day on the whiteboard to keep his students happy. I like that about his class. In his AP Statistics class, students learn about data in the world around them. The course emphasizes how good studies and experiments are made and how the results of studies can be used to make claims about the world. In his calculus class, he teaches students about derivatives and integrals. This means that students get to go more in depth with concepts they learned in their algebra classes. $onStopped=1
